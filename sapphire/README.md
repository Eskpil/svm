### Sapphire

    The actual programming language, utilizing the virtual machine.
    The compiler for sapphire will support both streaming the vm instructions directly
    to the virtual machine and compiling to a bytecode.

## Important:
    
    Work has not been started, but will start soon.

## Goals

    1. Automatic reference counting instead of garbadge collection. Will only apply for structs.
    2. Procedural and Imperativ just like c
    3. Modern features like features of go and elixir
    4. Verbose type system
    5. First class utf-32 support
    6. Some close representation of a goroutine, probably one also inspired by some erlang concurrency model
    7. No libc
