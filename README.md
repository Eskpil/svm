### SVM

Svm is just my toy virtual machine
which is now also hopefully turing complete

Windows or macos is of no priority
but i am open to pr for windows or macos

Run it with ./run.sh svm

### ASM

This directory is only temporary. It exists to make the writing of byte encoded arch instructions easier.
